# Form-Validation-project

#My second web development project focuses on form validation, using the following tech stack:

- **HTML**: Structures the form and its input fields.
- **CSS**: Ensures a clean, user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements real-time validation logic, checking input fields for errors and providing instant feedback.

This project highlights my ability to build a comprehensive form validation system that enhances user experience while maintaining data integrity.
